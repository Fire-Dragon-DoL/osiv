# OSIV - On Screen Image Viewer
This script will allow you to easily show images over full screen programs like games,
while keeping the ability to play.

## Features

- **Click through** will allow you to play without risk to get out focus from your game window
- **Resize image** will allow you to easily resize window to resize the image too
- **Borderless** double clicking on the image will activate borderless click-through mode

## Usage

Simply drag an image over the exe file (or a shortcut).  
You can just resize the image to the size you want, double click on it to go into *borderless mode*
which will allow you to play while clicking through the window (so no focus issues).

To exit *borderless mode* select OSIV on your taskbar (just click it with left mouse button or alt-tab to it)
and press ESC.

You can change the opacity of the window used in *borderless mode* in the settings.ini file

## Download

You can just download the compiled version contained in the
[osiv.zip](https://github.com/Fire-Dragon-DoL/osiv/blob/master/osiv.zip?raw=true "OSIV redistributable") file

## TODO

- Save window position on a per-image basis
- Multiple file opening (dragging multiple images should open multiple instances of the script)
- Adding a menu to change opacity settings (on a per-image basis with a default one), while keeping
the "portability" of the script, so no requirement to install (and possibly do not store anything in
user folder)
